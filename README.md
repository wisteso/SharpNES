# SharpNES

This is a for-fun project (no commercial use) aimed at understanding how the NES hardware (notably the 6502 chip) works.

It is heavily based on other open source work - especially for OpCode handling logic. Currently, much of the execution requires manual hard-coding of values to work correctly, since this only an initial version prototype.
